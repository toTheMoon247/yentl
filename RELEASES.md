# Releases

Milestone-based version history for Yentl. Each entry is a **significant, tested
checkpoint** — a stable, verified state of the project — not a per-commit log.
Every entry has a matching annotated Git tag, so any milestone is a clean
rollback point if later work breaks something.

## Conventions

- **Tags are annotated and semver, pre-1.0:** `v0.MINOR.0`. The minor number
  bumps once per milestone. `v1.0.0` is reserved for the first App Store launch
  (Phase 13).
- **A milestone is only tagged when it is verified:** CI is green on the tagged
  commit *and* the milestone's behavior has been exercised (built/run, or
  validated end-to-end where it involves runtime auth/UI).
- **Major milestones only.** Examples: Google OAuth complete, Authentication
  complete, Onboarding complete, Profile Creation complete. Routine commits,
  refactors, and CI tweaks do not get entries.
- Entries are newest-first.

## Rolling back

To return to a known-good milestone:

```bash
git checkout v0.1.0          # inspect the milestone (detached HEAD)
# or, to branch from it and continue:
git switch -c recover-from-0.1.0 v0.1.0
```

`git tag` lists all milestones; `git show v0.1.0` shows the tag's notes and the
commit it points at.

## v0.5.0 — Matchmaker Queue & Decision Panel (2026-06-06)

Phase 5 complete: a matchmaker pulls up the front-of-queue user and reviews
their mutual-like candidates in the Decision Panel. Validated against seeded
data; CI green. (Creating the match is Phase 6.)

- **Queue:** `matchmaking_queue` (M/F alternating), enqueued on profile go-live
  (trigger + backfill). Staff-only security-definer RPCs: `next_queued_user`,
  `queued_profiles` (Queue tab), `requeue_user` ("Next profile" — non-destructive,
  sends the user to the back), `matchmaker_candidates`, `matchmaker_like_stats`.
- **Candidates = mutual likes** (liked both ways), shown in a swipeable card
  carousel; tap a card for the full profile (with hidden fields).
- **Empty state is a decision:** a received-vs-given diagnostic steers Boost
  (Phase 10) vs Next.
- **Matchmaker app:** Review + Queue tabs; card-based panel with a pinned-user
  card, Match/Boost buttons (stubbed for Phases 6/10), and an account menu.
  Photos use the shared in-memory image cache (instant).

Migrations: `20260605203625_matchmaking_queue`, `20260606071144_queue_list_and_requeue`.

Decisions: candidates are mutual-only (matchmaker curates among mutual interest);
internal notes and the compatibility indicator cut; **attractiveness rating +
percentiles deferred to post-MVP** (subjective, calibration-heavy — closes Phase 5
at one slice). Dev: `seed_mutual_likes.sql` creates varied mutual counts.

Not included: match creation + 24h confirmation (Phase 6); Boost mechanic
(Phase 10); attractiveness rating / percentiles (post-MVP).

## v0.4.0 — Discovery & Likes (2026-06-04)

Phase 4 complete: users swipe through other live profiles and the system records
likes/passes (no matches yet — those come from the matchmaker). Validated
end-to-end against seeded profiles; CI green.

- **Discovery feed:** `discovery_feed` security-definer RPC returns only public
  columns for live, opposite-gender, not-yet-swiped candidates — so the hidden
  height/income never leak to other consumers. `swipes` table + `swipe_action`
  enum with own-RW / staff-read RLS (no consumer-facing "likes you" — that data
  is the matchmaker's, in Phase 5).
- **Review state (mocked Phase 3):** `profile_review_state` column on `profiles`,
  set to `live` on completion for MVP; discovery filters on it. The real
  approval pipeline stays Phase 12.
- **Yentl UI:** a new tab bar (Discover / Profile); a draggable `SwipeCard`
  (drag or buttons to like/pass, tap for full detail), empty/error states, and a
  DEBUG-only "Reset swipes" button for testing.
- **Performance:** next-card photo prefetch + an in-memory decoded-image cache,
  so swiping feels instant after the first card.

Migrations: `20260603171739_discovery_and_swipes`, `20260603193210_swipes_delete_own`.

Dev tooling: `supabase/dev/seed_profiles.sql` (40 seeded profiles) and
`upload_seed_photos.sh` (gender-matched photo upload). Also: repo made public
(free CI) and the `profile-photos` storage read RLS extended so live profiles'
photos are visible in discovery.

Not included (tracked, deferred): photo URLs in the feed RPC; image variants
(thumb/medium/full); CDN; the `profile_approval_enabled` flag (lands in Phase 12
where it's first used).

## v0.3.0 — Profile Creation (2026-06-03)

Phase 2 complete: a user builds a full profile in Yentl and a matchmaker opens
it (public + hidden fields) in Yentl Matchmaker. Validated end-to-end; CI green.
Built in five vertical slices, each its own CI-green commit:

- **Slice 1 — Basics:** `profiles` table + `gender` enum + owner/staff RLS;
  `ProfileService` (`saveBasics`/`isProfileComplete`); basics wizard step; an
  **account-stage router** (onboarding → profile → ready) folding in the
  Phase-1 account-state model.
- **Slice 2 — Photos:** `profile_photos` table + a **private storage bucket**
  with per-user-folder RLS; upload/reorder/delete/signed-URL ops; client-side
  downscale; PhotosPicker UI. (Fixed an RLS bug: Swift's uppercase UUID vs
  Postgres lowercase `auth.uid()`.)
- **Slice 3 — Details:** bio / height / income / `interests[]` columns +
  `profile_prompts` table; **preset** prompt & interest lists; details step
  (optional) + private step (**height/income required**).
- **Slice 4 — Preview & viewer:** reusable `PublicProfileCard` + `ProfileScreen`
  loader (shared); wizard **preview** step; consumer **home shows your own
  profile**; matchmaker **profile browser → viewer with hidden height/income**.
- **Slice 5 — Edit:** reusable `PhotoManager`; `EditProfileView` (single
  prefilled form); **Edit** button on home with refresh-on-save.

Migrations: `20260602200247_profiles_table`, `20260603025651_profile_photos`,
`20260603031656_profile_details`.

Decisions locked: height/income **required**; prompts/interests from fixed
**preset lists**; hidden fields stored on `profiles` (protecting them from other
consumers is the Phase 4 discovery projection's job).

Not included (tracked for later): image variant generation (thumb/medium/full —
deferred within Phase 2; one downscaled JPEG per photo for now); profile
approval (mocked in Phase 3, real in Phase 12).

## v0.2.0 — Onboarding (2026-06-01)

Post-sign-in onboarding for the Yentl consumer app, validated end-to-end in the
simulator; CI green on all jobs.

- After first Google sign-in, signed-in users pass through a one-time onboarding
  gate before the home screen: **Welcome → privacy note → terms/consent + 18+
  confirmation** (both toggles required to continue).
- Consent is recorded **server-side, account-scoped** (not device-local):
  migration `20260601202049_onboarding_fields.sql` adds `terms_accepted_at`,
  `age_confirmed_at`, and `onboarding_completed_at` to `public.users`, plus a
  `security definer` `complete_onboarding()` RPC that stamps them for
  `auth.uid()` only (no self-UPDATE RLS policy, so role escalation stays
  impossible by construction).
- `AuthService.isOnboardingComplete()` / `completeOnboarding()`; Yentl
  `ContentView` routes through `OnboardingFlow` until completion, mirroring the
  Matchmaker role-gate pattern.
- Verified persistence: relaunching after completion routes straight to home.

Not included (tracked for later): full Terms of Service / Privacy Policy pages
and stricter age verification (Phase 11); onboarding gate for the Matchmaker app
(staff-only, not needed yet).

## v0.1.0 — Authentication (2026-05-31)

First known-good checkpoint. The authentication system is complete and verified
on both apps; CI is green on all jobs.

- Google Sign-In + Supabase Auth handshake, validated end-to-end in the
  simulator (Google → callback → `auth.users` → trigger → `public.users`).
- Backend: `public.users` table, `user_role` enum (`user`/`matchmaker`/`admin`),
  auto-creation trigger, and RLS policies (migration
  `20260530202003_users_table_and_rls.sql`).
- Matchmaker role gate validated: `user` → Access Pending; promotion to
  `matchmaker`/`admin` → `MatchmakerHomeView`.
- Session persistence (Keychain, auto-refresh) made explicit; shared
  `SignOutButton` wired into both apps; logout reliable offline.
- CI green across shared package, both iOS app builds, and SwiftLint
  (iOS builds run via shared schemes).

Not included (tracked for later milestones): onboarding screens
(welcome/privacy/terms), the full account-state model, and real Apple Sign-In
(stubbed until Phase 8).
